# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  failure to properly handle errors that may occur during database operations within route handlers.  The provided code lacks error handling, which can lead to server crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version that incorporates comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks and appropriate status codes.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js`. 
4. Simulate a database error (e.g., by uncommenting the error-throwing line in `bug.js`).

Observe the resulting error behavior.  Then, switch to the corrected `bugSolution.js` to see how to handle this correctly.
